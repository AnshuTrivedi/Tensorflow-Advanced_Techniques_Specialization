- Describe design options when using transfer learning
- Implement object localization with a CNN
- Implement an image classifier with transfer learning


multi class classification - Each instance is assigned to one and only one class.
multilevel classification - Each instance can be assigned to multiple classes simultaneously. each instance can belong to multiple classes.

Object localization - bounding box indicating where object is in the image 
Object detection models-  classify all objects present in the image with confidence scores, and it predicts that bounding boxes as well. 
- Combining multi-label classification and object localization gives you object detecton.
- Popular algorithms for object detection are R-CNN,(R for region),Faster-RCNN, YOLO(you only lock once) and SSD(single shot detector) 

Image segmentaion - 
 - Instead of locating an object within a rectangular bounding box, segmentation instead figures out the pixels that make up that object.
 - There are two types of image segmentation, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. 
 - With semantic segmentation, all objects of the same type form a single classification.
 - For instance segmentation, each instance of a person is identified as a separate segment.
   In semantic segmentation, all objects of the same class are regarded as one segment. Each pixel is usually associated with a class.
 - In instance segmentation, multiple objects of the same class are regarded as separate segments
- Popular machine learning models that solve semantic segmentation are: Fully Convolutional Neural Networks, U-net, DeepLab
- One popular algorithm that solves instance segmentation is Mask R-CNN.

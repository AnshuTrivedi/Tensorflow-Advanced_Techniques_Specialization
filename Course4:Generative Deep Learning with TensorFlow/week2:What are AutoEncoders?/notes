AutoEncoders Inroduction
- NN capable of learning dense representation of data without supervision( unlabelled training data)
- useful for dimentionality reduction and visualization 
- can be used to geenrate new data that resembles input data
- learn efficient ways to represent data 
- An autoencoder is a special type of neural network that is trained to copy its input to its output.
  For example, given an image of a handwritten digit, an autoencoder first encodes the image into a lower dimensional latent representation,
   then decodes the latent representation back to an image. 
- An autoencoder learns to compress the data while minimizing the reconstruction error.
- in practice AutoEncoders copy input to output, and efficient representation of inout data

First Encoder:
- 23, 35, 47, 50, 14
- 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121
- In this example AutoEnoder learns latent representaion of data that is numbers are squares of number so easy to remember second sequence

- In AutoEncoder no of neurons in output layer should be same as input neurons.

Deep AutoEncoders:(encoder, the decoder can also have multiple layers)
- in order to achieve encoding and decoding for more complex images, a stacked auto encoder architecture can be used
